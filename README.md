#API Project

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive information about the Node API project, designed with best practices in mind. The project utilizes Node.js, Express, and potentially MongoDB for data storage. It employs OpenAPI specifications for API documentation and Swagger UI for interactive API documentation.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file.
4. Run the application: `npm start`

## API Routes

### Product Routes

- `GET /api/product`: Fetches a list of all products.
- `POST /api/product`: Creates a new product. Requires a `name` in the body.
- `GET /api/product/:id`: Fetches a specific product by ID.
- `PUT /api/product/:id`: Updates a specific product by ID. Requires a `name` in the body.
- `DELETE /api/product/:id`: Deletes a specific product by ID.

### Update Routes

- `GET /api/update`: Fetches a list of all updates.
- `GET /api/update/:id`: Fetches a specific update by ID.
- `POST /api/update`: Creates a new update. Requires `title`, `body`, and `productId` in the body.
- `PUT /api/update/:id`: Updates a specific update by ID. Requires `title`, `body`, and `status` in the body.
- `DELETE /api/update/:id`: Deletes a specific update by ID.

### UpdatePoints Routes

- `GET /api/updatepoints`: Fetches a list of all update points.
- `GET /api/updatepoints/:id`: Fetches a specific update point by ID.
- `PUT /api/updatepoints/:id`: Updates a specific update point by ID.
- `POST /api/updatepoints`: Creates a new update point. Requires `name` and `description` in the body, and `updateId`.
- `DELETE /api/updatepoints/:id`: Deletes a specific update point by ID.


## Authentication and Authorization

This API uses JWT for authentication. To authenticate, send a request with the Authorization header set to `Bearer <token>`.

## Database Schema

The database schema is defined using Prisma or another ORM. Include details about tables/collections, fields, and data types.

## Middleware

- **Error Handling Middleware**: Handles errors and sends appropriate responses.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes.

## Testing

To run tests, use the command `npm test`. Include details about what each test covers.

## Deployment

Provide instructions for deploying the API to a cloud provider or hosting service.

## API Documentation with Swagger

This project uses Swagger UI Express for interactive API documentation. To access the documentation, navigate to `/api-docs` in your browser.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the Node API project, covering setup, endpoints, authentication, and more. For further details, refer to the OpenAPI specification and Swagger UI documentation.
